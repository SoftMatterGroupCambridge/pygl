## PyMAFT: Active field theories in Python [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rajeshrinet/pymaft/master?filepath=binder)

## About
[PyMAFT](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pymaft) is a Python (and Cython) package for numerical simulations of **M**odels of **A**ctive **F**ield **T**heories.

The above simulation is done using PyMAFT. It shows that the droplet growth is interrupted via a self-shearing instability for contractile stress in active model H. Read more: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04819

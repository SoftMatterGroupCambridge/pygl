## About
[PyMAFT](https://github.com/rajeshrinet/pymaft) is a numerical library for simulations of **M**odels of **A**ctive **F**ield **T**heories in Python.


![Self-shearing instability in active scalar field theory](examples/ssi.gif)

The above simulation is done using PyMAFT. It shows that the droplet growth is interrupted via a self-shearing instability for contractile stress in active model H. Read more: https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04819
